New markets are created via the Factory Contract. When calling `add_market`, the contract automatically deploys a AMM and a Controller from the corresponding set implementations.

The Controller is the contract the user interacts with to **create a loan** and further mangage the position. It holds all user debt information. External liquidations are also done through it.
