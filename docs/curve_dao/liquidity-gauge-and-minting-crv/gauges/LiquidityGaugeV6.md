$$I_{u} = \int \frac{r'(t)b_{u}(t)}{S(t)}dt$$

| Variable | Description |
| :------: | --- |
| $I_{u}$ | Amount of tokens the user has to have minted to him |
| $r'(t)$ | |



Example without boosting:

```
inflation rate: r = 10%
gauge weight: w_g = 0.3 (30%)
gauge type weight: w_t = 1 (100%)

adjusted inflation rate: r' = w_g * w_t * r = 0.3 * 1 * 0.1 = 0.03 or 3% of the CRV emissions allocated to the gauge annualy (no changes assumed).

users balance:      b_u(t) = 1_000 LP tokens
total liquidity:    S(t) = 10_000 LP tokens
time period:        Î”t = 1 year (for simplification)
```

calculation assuming no boost:
I_u = (0.3 * 1000)/10000 * 1 = 0.003 or 0.3% of the total CRV emissions allocated to the user.


with boost:
when the user has a boost, the b_u(t) is adjusted:

b_u(t) = min(0.4 * b_u + 0.6 * S * (w_i / W), b_u)


---

$w_i: b_u^* = \min(0.4 \times b_u + 0.6 \times S \times \frac{w_i}{W}, b_u)$

| Variable | Description |
| :------: | --- |
| $w_i$ | vecrv balance of user |
| $b_u$ | LP token balance deposited into the gauge |
| $S$ | total LP tokens deposited into the gauge |
| $W$ | total veCRV |
| $b_u^*$ | boosted balance of the user |

## Overview

What is a gauge? what does it do?
- stake lp tokens in the gauge
- gauge measures liquidity across every depositor and distributes rewards accordingly
- gauges are always specified to one liquitiy pool. every pool needs its own gauge.




A liquidity gauge essentially measures the liquidity provided by users. These gauges can be used to incentivise users to provide liquitiy by directying rewards to it. Generally, there are two ways to add rewards to a gauge:

**CRV Emissions**

CRV Emissions: Curve works in a way that veCRV holders can decide where future CRV emissions go to. A possible destination is a liquidity gauge. Before gauges are elegible to receive CRV emissions, they need to be added to the `GaugeController.vy` contract. Adding requires a successfully passed DAO vote. Once added, the gauge is elegible to be voted for (so called gauge weight voting). Once a gauge receives gauge weight by users voting for it, the gauge receives CRV emissions. Weight changes always take effect every Thursday at 00:00 UTC. Depending on the weight, the gauge essentially receives a fixed amount of CRV over the next 7 days until the gauge weights update again.


**External Rewards**

Besides receiving CRV emissions due to voting for the gauge weight, addresses with certain rights can add external rewards to a gauge.

## Depositing and Withdrawing

Liquidity pool (LP) tokens can be deposited into or withdrawn from the gauge at any time.

In user interfaces and documentation, the terms "staking" and "unstaking" are often used in relation to gauges. However, the source code for the smart contract employs the terms `deposit` and `withdraw` instead.

When LP tokens are deposited into the gauge, the smart contract issues an equivalent amount of "gauge tokens" to the depositor. This ensures that when tokens are withdrawn, the depositor receives the exact amount of LP tokens originally deposited, maintaining the value of the initial investment. It's important to note that LP tokens are transferable.

!!!example
    Alice deposits 100 crvUSD into the crvUSD/USDC liquidity pool and receives 99 LP tokens in return. Observing significant gauge weight and subsequent CRV emissions in this pool, she opts to deposit her LP tokens into the gauge. Consequently, she begins to earn CRV rewards based on her liquidity share and her boost factor within the pool.

## Claiming Rewards

Reward tokens can be claimed using the `claim_rewards` function. This claims externally added rewards from the gauge. 

To claim CRV rewards, which were directed through the gauge weight, the user needs to claim those from the `Minter.vy` using the `mint` function.




can you claim someone elses rewards for him?


checks `reward_count` to see how many tokens need to be claimed.

### `rewards_receiver`

## Permissionless Rewards

Newer liquidity gauges open the possibility to add permissionless rewards. Permissionless may be a weird terminology for this. Only the deployer of the gauge can add third-party rewards. This makes sense as otherwise users could spam the gauge with random shitcoins. 

There is a gauge `manager` set to `tx.origin` for each gauge.

To be able to add rewards to the gauge, a reward token and distributor needs to be added by calling the `add_reward` funtion. This can only be done by the `manager` or the `admin` of the Factory. There can only be one distributor for a reward tokens. The distributor himself can transfer the ability to add the specific reward token.


!!!warning
    Externally added rewards are not boostable. They are distributed according to the user's liquidity share in the gauge.

    E.g. if Alice amounts to a total of 10% of LP tokens staked in the gauge, she will receive 10% of the externally added rewards assuming no changes if liquidity share or reward amount.

## Killing Gauges

Liquidity gauges have a "killed status" stored in `is_killed`. This status can be set by the `admin` of the Factory, which was used to initially deploy the gauge using the `set_killed` function. If the status is set to `True`, the gauges `rate` and `future_rate` will be set to zero and it will not be eligible to receive any more CRV emissions.

"Killing a gauge" can be undone by simply setting the `is_killed` status back to `false` using the `set_killed` function again.

## Boosting your LP tokens

Provided liquidity is boosted by the veCRV balance of the user. Liquidity can be boosted up to 2.5 times. The gauges adjust the `working_balances` of users according to a user's boost.

The [`working_balances`](#working_balances) of a user are adjusted whenever their LP token balance changes:

- Transferring tokens: `working_balances` are adjusted for both the sender and receiver of the LP tokens.
- Depositing LP tokens into the gauge.
- Withdrawing LP tokens from the gauge.
- A manual checkpoint was done using the `user_checkpoint` function.
- When a user is "kicked" for abusing their boost (more [here](#kick)).

$$\text{lim} = \text{lim} + L \times \frac{\text{voting_balance}}{\text{voting_total}} \times 0.6$$

$$\text{lim} = \min(l, \text{lim})$$

$$\text{boost factor} = \frac{lim}{l}$$

*with:*

| Variable                | Description                                  |

[^1]: A user does not neccessarily need to deposit the LP into the gauge himself. Someone else can deposit for him or the "staked LP token" can be transfered to him.

---


Let's examine two different users. Both are providing the same amount of LP tokens (same liquidity), but the first user does not receive a boost because he does not have any veCRV. The second user has a veCRV balance of 500. The total veCRV balance is assumed to be 10,000.


```shell
l = 1000                                    # users LP tokens in gauge
L = 50000                                   # total LP tokens in gauge

voting_balance_user1 = 0                    # veCRV balance user1
voting_balance_user2 = 500                  # veCRV balance user2
voting_total = 10000                        # total veCRV balance
```



### NO BOOST

*Lets calculate the LP position of a user that has a vecrv balance of 0.*

$\text{lim} = 1000 * 0.4 = 400$

$\text{lim} = 400 + 50000 * \frac{0}{10000} * 0.6 = 400$

$\text{lim} = \min(1000, 400)$

*The working supply of this user is 400 LP tokens. The boost is calculated by:*

$\text{boost factor} = \frac{400}{400} = 1$

## Checkpointing a Gauge

What does a gauge actually do?

It updates general stuff like:

- `period`
- `period_timestamp`
- `integrate_inv_supply`

Updates user-specific integrals:

- `integrate_fraction`
- `integrate_inv_supply_of`
- `integrate_checkpoint_of`
