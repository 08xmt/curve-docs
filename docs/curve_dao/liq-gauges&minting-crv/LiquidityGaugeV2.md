The v2 liquidity gauge adds a full ERC20 interface to the gauge, tokenizing deposits so they can be directly transferred between accounts without having to withdraw and redeposit. It also improves flexibility for onward staking, allowing staking to be enabled or disabled at any time and handling up to eight reward tokens at once.
