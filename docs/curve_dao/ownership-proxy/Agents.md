## **Agents**

The Curve DAO has a total of three [Aragon Agent](https://legacy-docs.aragon.org/aragon/readme) ownership addresses, which are governed by two independent DAOs:

1.  The **Community DAO** (or just “the DAO”) governs the day-to-day operation of the protocol.

    Voting is based on a user’s holdings of “Vote Escrowed CRV” (veCRV). veCRV is obtained by locking CRV for up to 4 years, with 1 veCRV equal to 1 CRV locked for 4 years. As the lock time decreases, An account’s veCRV balance decreases linearly as the time remaining until unlock decreases. veCRV is non-transferrable.

    An account must have a minimum balance of 2500 veCRV to make a DAO vote. Each vote lasts for one week. Votes cannot be executed until the entire week has passed.  


    The DAO has ownership of two admin accounts: 

    The **ownership admin** controls most functionality within the protocol. Performing an action via the ownership admin requires a 30% quorum with 51% support.  
    
    The **parameter admin** has authority to modify parameters on pools, such as adjusting the amplification co-efficient. Performing an action via the paramater admin requries a 15% quorum with 51% support.

2. The **Emergency DAO** has limited authority to kill pools and gauges during extraordinary circumstances.

    The emergency DAO consists of nine members, comprised of a mix of the Curve team and prominent figures within the DeFi community. Each member has one vote. Any member may propose a vote.

    All members of the emergency DAO may propose new votes. A vote lasts for 24 hours and can be executed immediately once it receives 66% support.
