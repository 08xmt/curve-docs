# Curve Docs

[curve.fi](https://curve.fi) protocol documentation.

`master` branch is auto-deployed at https://docs.curve.fi/.

Currently, the priority lies in two aspects:

- Transferring the old documentation to the new [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) format and completing the unfinished sections
- Focus on the documentation for crvUSD (LLAMMA).
