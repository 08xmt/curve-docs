The new CurveFi Docs are being written using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). MkDocs is widely favored in the professional documentation space for its intuitive markdown syntax, customizable themes, seamless navigation and versioning capabilities.

All pushes to master get auto-deployed [here](https://docs.curve.fi/).

**Currently, the priority lies in two aspects: firstly, transferring the old documentation to the new mkdocs format and completing the unfinished sections; secondly, focusing on the documentation for crvUSD (LLAMMA).**
